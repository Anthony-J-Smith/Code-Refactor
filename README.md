# Code-Refactor

What Was Done On This Project:
HTML:
-Space out all the code for readability
-Added "title" attribute to tags with class="hero" to describe the image
-Added alt attributes to the images whose alt attributes were absent
-img tags corrected/synchronized for ./assets/images/cost-manegment.png
-Changed header tags of "made with <heart> by Horiseon" to h4 tags.
-Changed all non-codebreaking tags to semantic tags (when <nav> was used in place of <div> it messed up the text and no solution was apparent in the css file; instead the <nav> was used inside the <div> tags.)
